Moment Neural Network (MNN) documentation
=====================

`MNN`_ is a new class of deep learning architecture which naturally generalizes rate-based neural networks to second order statistical moments. Once trained, the parameters of the MNN can be directly used to recover the corresponding SNN without further fine-tuning. The trained model captures realistic firing statistics of biological neurons including broadly distributed firing rates and Fano factors as well as weak pairwise correlation.
