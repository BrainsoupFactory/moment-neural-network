PART 1 Quick start: how to run the simple MNIST demo

1. Clone the source code to your local directory
2. Edit config file (add explanatory descriptions in the config file)
3. To train the MNN & to simulate the correponding SNN, run the command: python mnist.py --dir=OUTPUT_DIRECTORY --config=NAME_OF_THE_DIRECTORY_WHERE_CONFIG_FILE_IS_STORED

Brief explanation what each step does in the demo script.
1. loading config file
2. trianing mnn
3. simultating snn


PART 2 Output format
1. how to inspect the trained network (how to load the model)
2. how to run the trained network (mnn) (for post-training analysis or application etc)

PART 3 Reconstruting and running SNN
1. 

PART 4 Custom models

1. Define custom model
(which file need to be changed)
(for future development/integration into the main project)

2. Define dataset and dataloader

3. Define loss functions
